## Description

This app is your personal dictionary. Write down the words you want to learn, create translations, transcriptions, add audio and hints, and then take an exam to better remember these words.

Create lists for special topics such as "animals" or "law". Customize the time you want to take the exam and how often you want to repeat the exam.

Choose between a daily compulsory exam, which contains no more than 10 words, with the highest priority, and an infinite exam, which contains all the words you have written down, or take the exam exclusively on your personal lists, such as "interview" to repeat all the necessary words for the interview.

The newly created word has a default priority, every time you answer correctly during the exam the priority decreases, if you answer incorrectly it increases. Words with the highest priority are included in your exam, so if you think you haven't studied the word enough and you want to see it in the exam, you can change the priority on the word editing screen
